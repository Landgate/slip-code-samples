FindMyMineSite Demo App
================

This is a wee sample app that demonstrates the more complex scenario of using SLIP Future to locate minesites within 5km of a townsite chosen by the user.

It's comprised of:

- The Google Maps JavaScript API (to display the Townsites layer and allow user interaction via mouse click events)
- The Google Maps Engine API accessed via PHP (to filter the minesites to those within 5km of the given point)
- Bootstrap (UI only)
- Some jQuery (laziness)
