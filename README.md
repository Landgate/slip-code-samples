SLIP Future Code Samples
================

Welcome,

Herein you shall find a range of code samples for interacting with SLIP Future, Landgate's new Google Maps Engine-based version of SLIP - Western Australia's spatial data repository.

The initial set of code samples primarily concern themselves with visualising data (WMS, WMTS, Google Maps JavaScript API) or extracting the underlying raw feature data (the Google Maps Engine API). We plan to expand the range of samples over time to include more languages (e.g. Python), more endpoints (i.e. WFS), and more complex sample applications demonstrating some of the more advanced features of Google Maps Engine.

The data used are all publicly availabe from Landgate's *Locate* map service. In early 2014 developers in our SLIP Academy will receive access to a sandbox map service where they will be able to safely experiment with SLIP Future, including performing write operations and accessing a range of restricted datasets.

If you spot any bugs in these samples, or have an idea of a code sample you'd like to see, do please file an issue in GitHub. If you have any trouble accessing SLIP Future, or there's something you'd like to do but aren't show of how, please [contact us](https://github.com/Landgate/slip-developer-documentation/wiki/Contact-Us).

> Much more information, FAQs, tips, and a list of known issues is available in our [technical documentation](https://github.com/Landgate/slip-developer-documentation/wiki).

Cheers, and happy hacking,

The SLIP Future Team
